## PROJECT OVERVIEW
### Context
The United States Environmental Protection Agency reports that transportation is the largest contributor of the U.S.â€™s greenhouse gas emissions (gge) -- 28% of total gge.  The model developed for this project intends to help individuals better understand what features of their car can help inform them what may indicate more or less greenhouse gas emissions from the tailpipe of their car.

### Goal
Using a linear regression model, identify features in non-electric cars that have a relationship with the total greenhouse gas emissions from that car's tailpipe and also find to what degree each of those features affect the greenhouse gas emissions total.  

### Findings
Multiple features of non-electric cars were explored to build a linear regression model: engine capacity (in liters), number of cylinders, transmission type, transmission speed, fuel type, and year of car model.  Engine capacity and number of cylinders had a very strong correlation to greenhouse gas emissions (0.77 and 0.74 respectively) -- but also susceptible to collinearity so in need to exclude one of them in the model, number of cylinders was removed while engine capacity was kept in due to its higher correlation to greenhouse gas emissions between the two features. In refining features for the optimal model performance, a major hurdle was addressing collinearity, but with feature refinement that was addressed.  Year of car model was an important feature, handled by spliting the years into categories of pre-regulations period (1984-2011) and regulations period (2012-2021).

The final features selected for the model were:
- x1 = Engine Capacity (in liters)
- x2 = Automatic Transmission (a 'dummy' value of 1)
- x3 = Premium Gas (a 'dummy' value of 1)
- x4 = Regular Gas (a 'dummy' value of 1)
- x5 = Model Year between 2012-2021 (a 'dummy' value of 1)

Ridge was used to refine the coefficients.  The final formula for the model is:
Yp  =  227.88 + 60.2(x1) + 13.46(x2) + 47.5(x3) + 32.66(x4) - 63.29(x5)

The R^2 for this model is 69%
The Mean Absolute Error is 47.2


### Conclusion
The model demonstrates a relationship between a car's greenhouse gas emissions to its engine capacity, transmission type, fuel type, and model year -- and that relationship can be shown as a linear relationship.  

The linear regression model indicates that a car is more likely to have lower greenhouse gas emissions from its tailpipe if the car has low engine capacity, manual transmission, regular gas, and its model year is between 2012 - 2021.



## METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

- **Methods used for collection/generation of data**:
All data was gathered through web-scraping [FuelEconomy.gov](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/) -- specifically the results from the website's ['Find and Compare Cars' - 'Browse by 'Model' tool](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.shtml). Website is in html.

- **Methods for processing and cleaning the data**:
Functions for web-scraping were developed for relatively 'clean' gathering of data, so minimal effort was needed once data was scraped through the function and all cars' data was pulled together. For minor changes to naming, pandas was used.

- **Methods for analysis and modeling**:
To prepare data for analysis and modeling, dummies were created for categorical data where needed and some features were removed that were known to be irrelevant to finding predicted value of greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe of car (the 'yp'). Correlations were then evaluated between all features via numerical, heatmap, and graphs.  Using `statsmodels` the parameters were developed in a linear regression model for features to find predicted value of greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe of car.


## DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

- **File List**:
    * [Web Scraping Functions](data_and_analysis/data/master_functions.py) - functions used for web scraping to obtain information for each car's year-make-model.  ipynb version is [here](data_and_analysis/data/master_functions.ipynb)

    * [Individual Car Data Collection (Mitsubishi example)](data_and_analysis/data/mitsubishi_data.ipynb) - one example of format for how each car's year-make-model was collected through web-scraping.  All cars (25) were then pulled into a [master data file](data_and_analysis/data/all_cars_conjunction_junction_function.ipynb) (also linked below).  All other cars data sets follow format of `[makeofcar]_data.ipynb` for a file name and can be found in [full data and analysis folder](data_and_analysis)

    * [Master data file](data_and_analysis/data/all_cars_conjunction_junction_function.ipynb) - worksheet where all cars' data was pulled together to create master file.  csv of final data set is [here](data_and_analysis/csv/all_cars_df.csv)

    * [Exploratory Data Analysis & Model Development](data_and_analysis/all_cars_gge_model.ipynb) - worksheet where exploratory data analysis and linear regression model was developed, analyzed, and refined

    * [Images of Graphs](data_and_analysis/images) - folder to find all important graphs created during data analysis

- **Relationship between files**:
    * Files listed above are in order of collection and build from each other, but pickles have been made so that each file can be pulled independent of the other.  All pickles can be found in the [`data_and_analysis/pickles` folder](data_and_analysis/data/pickles)
